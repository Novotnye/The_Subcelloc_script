## Membrane proteins and proteomics of *Cronobacter* *sakazakii* cells: Reliable method for identification and subcellular localization

The Subcelloc script was created to automate the evaluation of the subcellular localization of a large number of proteins. It combines localization data obtained from the UniProKB database, as well as from PSORTb v.3.0.2 and Cello v.2.5. Additional information is provided by SignalP v.5.0 and TMHMM v.2.0, which predict the presence of a signal peptide and transmembrane helix, respectively. This script can be used to predict the subcellular localization of i) in silico proteomes (downloaded from UniProt) and ii) mass spectrometric data from bottom-up proteomics approaches. It was created in Anaconda (Python distribution) and optimized for use in MS Windows and Google Chrome. Please see our detailed **Guide 1 - Preprocessing and localization prediction by Subcelloc script** file. The main script pipeline is in the folder **cell_location_pipeline**.
For further analyses of proteins with ambiguous localization, please see **Guide 2 - Further data analysis**.
